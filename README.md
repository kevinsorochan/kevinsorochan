### Oh, hello ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on variations in whale food for marine mammal conservation

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning (semi) automated classification of plankton images

- My research interests include zooplankton ecology, marine mammal foraging ecology, larval ecology (and morphology!)
